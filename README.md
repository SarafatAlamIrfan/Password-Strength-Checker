# Custom Password Strength Checker in C++ðŸ”’

**Author:** Sarafat Alam Mozumder

This C++ program evaluates password strength using a multi-faceted approach, incorporating character variety, entropy analysis, and graph connectivity. The system assigns a strength score out of 20 and categorizes passwords as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Character Variety Check**: Ensures the password contains uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- **Entropy-Based Strength Analysis**: Uses a Huffman-like encoding technique to measure randomness.
- **Graph-Based Connectivity Test**: Analyzes character adjacency to evaluate complexity.
- **Interactive CLI Interface**: Users can input passwords and receive real-time feedback.
- 

## ðŸ“Œ Example Output
```
Enter password (or type 'exit' to quit): MyP@ssw0rd123

Password Strength Score: 18/20
Strength: Strong
```
